So  here we are again  
standing and staring...  

Maybe it's right now  
the time we're gonna do...  
what we are supposed to do...  

How many time have we been there  
and we felt the same, me and you.  
Maybe we should cut the bend  
and try the different view  

Ahh ah ah ah a-a ah  
We're trapped in chains  
fear from nothing  

Ahh ah ah ah a-a ah  
Empty silence,  
it's so heartbreaking  

It's getting worse and worse  
every moment, three times a week.  
Why the hell we forgot the sense,  
the sense of our pains...  

Ahh ah ah ah a-a ah  
We're trapped in chains  
fear from nothing  

Ahh ah ah ah a-a ah  
Empty silence,  
it's so heartbreaking  

So are we gonna fall?  
Will it be the same as it was before?  

We're trapped ind chains  
fear from nothing  

Ah ah ah ah a-a ah  
Empty silence, or empty words...
